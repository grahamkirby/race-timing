# _race-timing_ is a Java application for calculating race results

This software was originally written to process results for races organised by [Fife Athletic Club](https://fifeac.org),
although it would probably work for other races. Reports of success or otherwise would be welcome, by email to the
author.

The software supports several types of race:

* [individual races](blob/main/src/main/resources/individual_race/README.md)
* relay races
* series races
