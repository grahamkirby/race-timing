# Default entry map with 4 elements (bib number, full name, club, category), and no column combining or re-ordering.
1,2,3,4

# Columns can be re-ordered by permuting the column numbers, or combined into a single column with an intervening
# space character, by grouping column numbers with a dash.
# E.g. 1,3-2,4,5 would combine the second and third columns, reversing the order and concatenating with a space character.
